aight so we're gna define the activity object and do crud for it
activity and all its fields hv been defined

for whatever reason, I'm struggling a lot with just the post request. The error messsage is super vague:

Exception thrown: 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbUpdateException' in Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.dll
An exception of type 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbUpdateException' occurred in Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.dll but was not handled in user code
An error occurred while saving the entity changes. See the inner exception for details.

I'll go check it again tmr. Theoretically should be able to get crud done by tmr.


so it seems like i fixed it by doing the intitial create command in the nuget console.

files changed: 
MyDbContext.cs

files added:
Activity.cs
ActivityController.cs
CreateActivityRequest.cs
