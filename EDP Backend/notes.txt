we have 5 models to work on for backend:
	activity
	availability
	booking
	category
	reviews

we'll see how we're gna add tags later ig

checklist:
	activity - done (duh)
	availability - done
	booking - done
	category - done
	reviews - done with model

think through the admin/user access for bookings, 
cuz a standard get request for bookings would mean a customer can get everyone else's bookings.
I bet The user model has a simiar thing going on so mabe ask joseph.

I'm more or less done with all my entities for backend. There's a couple issues, though.
It's mostly easily changeable like what should the admin/customer have access to,
but also I need to figure out whether I have to make a catgoryParticipants model or smt like that.
Depends on whether 1 activity can b in multiple categories, I guess.

so here's the todo list for backend:
	decide what should customers hv access to
	Is there a need for another model between activiy and category
	also just check everything again

After this, we probably won't need to touch backend again so that's nice.
